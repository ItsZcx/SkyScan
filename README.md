# SkyScan
Before we start, the python script inside maps is NOT MINE, all credits belong to the creator, in this case: https://github.com/julienp17

This project is a 2D air traffic control simulation program written in C language with the help of CSFML. The program takes a file path as a parameter, which contains a script for the simulation. The program must display two types of entities: aircrafts and control towers and manage different situations regarding both the towers and the planes.

Use "./SkyScan -h" for further information.
